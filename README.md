**TO DO List** is a simple API project created with everything that I learned on course [Do Zero ao Deploy](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/do_zero_ao_deploy) by [CÃ¡ssio Botaro](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/).

This project covers the following concepts:
- Python environments with [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
- Test Driven Development with [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
- Starting with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework
- Continuous Integration with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
- Continuous Deployment with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

Starting from what has been taught, I improved the API with **MongoDB** persistence.
