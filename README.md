This is a simple TO DO List created with what I learned on course [Do Zero ao Deploy](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/do_zero_ao_deploy) from [CÃ¡ssio Botaro](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/).

This project covers the following concepts:
- Python environments with Pipenv
- Test Driven Development with PyTest
- Starting with Flask framework
- Continuous Integration with Travis
- Continuous Deployment with Heroku
